In today's digital age, online retail businesses must be able to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and customer demands. To achieve this, businesses need a robust and scalable software development platform that can streamline their operations and improve their customer experience. Salesforce, a cloud-based platform, offers a cloud-native approach to software development that is becoming increasingly popular in the industry. This paper will explore the concept of cloud-native development, industry best practices for developing software using Salesforce. Salesforce is a versatile software encompassing customer relationship management and cloud computing functionalities. It not only features Sales and Service cloud platforms tailored for customer-oriented organizations but also offers additional capabilities such as marketing automation, analytics, and application development through the Salesforce platform. Both of these components aim to foster closer connections within our society. Utilizing Salesforce enables businesses to efficiently address customer issues, whether they reach out via email or various social media channels. One of its key features is multitenancy, where multiple tenants or organizations share common resources like infrastructure, hardware, and code. This approach helps to reduce the total cost of ownership as each tenant's data is securely partitioned and hardware/code resources can be shared among users. Additionally, automatic upgrades ensure parity among all users' data.

While AWS offers many valuable services, it requires a higher level of technical expertise to work with than Salesforce. In terms of features and benefits, both Salesforce and AWS offer unique advantages. Salesforce is known for its ease of use and intuitive user interface, making it accessible to professionals in a variety of roles. Moreover, as the industry is slowly moving to a “no-code, low code” era, Salesforce clearly becomes a better option.
